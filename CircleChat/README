Circle Chat a lovely ring based chat program.

Architecture:
Each node has a next hop.  Each message is sent around the ring to each nodes next hop until it arrives at the source, who will not forward it.
A leech is not in the ring, but receives everything the host receives.  The host also forwards messages from the leech as if he were the source.

Files:
ChatClient.java
	Main, handles the GUI
Inbound.java
	Handles the inbound ring server
LeachClient.java
	Handles a leech connection to a host (leech server)
LeachServer.java
	Handles the host part of a leech user
Message.java
	Helps with message sending/receiving
SendAMessage.java
	Opens connection to next hop server.
Values.java
	Global values

To Do:
1. Add command to add in a user
2. Add second hop for handling drop outs (See Redundancy Discussion)
3. Add graceful exit to continue the chain if someone intentionally leaves
4. Change the protocol to be more useful than 4 lines
5. Improve GUI (SEE GUIDiscussion)

Bugs:
1. Leech messages show up on the leech's host twice (once when he first receives it and when it completes the ring)
